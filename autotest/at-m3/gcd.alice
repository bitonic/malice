x was a number and y was a number.
"Give first number:\n> " said Alice, what was x?
"Give second number:\n> " said Alice, what was y?
"The greatest common divisor is: " said Alice.
perhaps (y > x) so
  gcd(y, x) spoke.
or
  gcd(x, y) spoke.
Alice was unsure which.
"\n" said Alice.

The room gcd(number x, number y) contained a number
  perhaps (y == 0) so
    Alice found x.
  or
    Alice found gcd(y, x % y).
  Alice was unsure which.
